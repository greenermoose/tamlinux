# AI Collaboration & Provenance

This repository practices transparent AI-assisted engineering. We document the AI tools, models, prompts, and architectural decisions that shaped `fred.sysinfo`.

## 1. Fred's Multi-Agent AI Toolchain

Rather than relying on a single AI model or interface, Fred uses a specialized toolchain tailored to each tool's strengths. CLI versions below reflect the environment captured during development (`<tool> --version`).

| Tool & Interface | CLI Version | Backing Models | Primary Role in the Ecosystem |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Claude Code** (`claude`) | `2.1.267` | Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`) | **Architecture & System Planning**: Authoring durable system specifications, multi-step runbooks, and cross-cutting policies. |
| **Codex CLI** (`codex`) | `0.155.1` | `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra` | **Architecture & System Planning**: Second opinion on plans and specifications alongside Claude. |
| **Antigravity CLI** (`agy`) | `1.2.2` / `1.2.6` | Gemini 3.8 Flash (High) | **Coding, Refactoring & Implementation**: Primary coding partner for multi-file pair-programming, security remediation, bash/Python/QML engineering, and git release workflow. |
| **OpenCode** (`opencode`) | `1.18.30` | Big Pickle | **Distro & System Q&A**: Efficient lookups for Arch Linux / Omarchy package specifics and shell configuration, conserving frontier-model token budgets. |
| **Grok CLI** (`grok`) | `1.0.25` (`f7e67d6988e2`, stable) | Grok 4.6 | **Workstation Support**: Additional debugging, hardware diagnostics, and alternative implementation analysis. |

## 2. Key Architectural Milestones & AI Role

| Milestone | Version | Primary AI Partner | Key Decisions & Achievements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Universal Linux Telemetry Engine & Popout Panel** | `v1.0.0` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.2`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Designed pure-Python telemetry probe querying sysfs, procfs, hwmon, and PCI; built responsive Quickshell QML bar widget and popout panel with power profile switching and btop integration. |
| **Multi-Monitor Focus Isolation & Per-Monitor Dismissal** | `v1.1.0` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Implemented per-monitor focus isolation via custom `SysinfoPanel.qml` and `SysinfoStore.js`; eliminated cross-monitor dismiss twins and focus-stealing so background terminals/conversations retain focus; captured tightly cropped MSI monitor screenshot. |
| **Version Footers & Visual Status** | `v1.1.1` | Antigravity CLI (`agy 1.2.6`, `Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)`) | Embedded running version in bar icon hover tooltip and as a centered, styled footer at the bottom of the open telemetry panel (`Panel.qml`). |
| **Fresh Resource Hover & MSI Screenshots** | `v1.1.2` pre-release | Codex CLI (`codex 0.155.1`, `gpt-5.6-sol`) | Replaced the stale temperature/frequency hover with freshly probed CPU usage, available RAM, and free disk space; verified kernel hwmon temperature sources; captured updated hover and panel screenshots on the MSI display. |
